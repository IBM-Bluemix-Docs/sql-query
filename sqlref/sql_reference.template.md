# SQL reference

## Introduction
{: #chapterIntroduction}

{{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_full}} allows you to analyze and transform open data with SQL. It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.

The select statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from {{site.data.keyword.cos_full}} (COS),
process the data, and store it back on Cloud {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} eventually.

Because {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_short}} always writes the results of a query to a given location
in Cloud {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}}, you can use it as a data transformation service.
It provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically.
This includes control over data location, format, layout and partitioning.

A query statement can be submitted via {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_short}}'s web UI or programmatically,
either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use {{site.data.keyword.DSX_full}}
and the Python SDK in order to use {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_short}} interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries using {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}}.

## SQL query statement
{: #chapterSQLQueryStatement}

The general syntax of an SQL query statement is outlined below using the `query` clause and the `namedQuery` clause.

<h3 id="query">query</h3>

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/query.svg" target="./diagrams/query.svg" alt="syntax diagram for a query" layout="@break@" -->

<h3 id="namedQuery">namedQuery</h3>

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/namedQuery.svg" target="./diagrams/namedQuery.svg" alt="syntax diagram for a named query" layout="" -->

The query statement supports *common table expressions*. A common table expression permits defining a result table with a table name
that can be specified as a table name in any FROM clause of the fullselect that follows.

Common table expressions are defined by using the reserved keyword `WITH` followed by one or more *named queries*.
Each common table expression specified can also be referenced by name in the FROM clause of subsequent common table expressions.

Creating a common table expression avoids the overhead of creating and dropping an intermediate result object on
Cloud {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} that is needed only for a certain query.

Moreover, a common table expression is beneficial when the same result table must be shared in a fullselect.

<h3>Examples</h3>

The common table expression examples use values clauses to define tables inline. For more details about the values clause refer to [valuesClause](#valuesClause).

```sql
-- find the department with the highest total pay
WITH dtotal AS (
    SELECT
        col1 AS deptno,
        SUM(col3+col4) AS totalpay
    FROM  VALUES -- deptno, empid, salary, bonus
        (1, 1, 1000, 0), (1, 2, 2000, 500), (1, 3, 3000, 0),
        (2, 4, 5000, 200), (2, 5, 6000, 0), (2, 6, 4000, 0),
        (3, 7, 2000, 500), (3, 8, 2000, 500), (3, 9, 8000, 0)
    GROUP BY col1
)
SELECT deptno
FROM dtotal
WHERE totalpay = (SELECT MAX(totalpay) FROM  dtotal)
```
{: codeblock}

| DEPTNO |
|Â ------ |
| 2 |
<!--table-caption title="Query result for example 'find the department with the highest total pay'"-->

```sql
-- list products with a price above the average price
WITH  products AS (
    SELECT
        col1 AS productid,
        col2 AS price
    FROM VALUES -- productid, price
        (1, 10), (2, 20), (3, 30), (4, 40),
        (5, 5), (6, 10), (7, 15), (8, 40),
        (9, 100), (10, 200), (11, 300), (12, 400)
), avg_product_price AS (
    SELECT
        AVG(price) as avg_price
    FROM products
)
SELECT
    productid,
	price,
	(SELECT * FROM avg_product_price) AS avg_price,
	price-(SELECT * FROM avg_product_price) AS price_dist
FROM products WHERE price > (SELECT * FROM avg_product_price)
```
{: codeblock}

| PRODUCTID | PRICE | AVG_PRICE | PRICE_DIST |
| --------- | ----- | --------- | ---------- |
| 9         | 100   |  97.5     | 2.5        |
| 10        | 200   |  97.5     | 102.5      |
| 11        | 300   |  97.5     | 202.5      |
| 12        | 400   |  97.5     | 302.5      |
<!--table-caption title="Query result for example 'list products with a price above the average price'"-->

<h3 id="cosResultClause">cosResultClause</h3>

You can use the Cloud {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} result clause to apply detailed control over the location, format and layout of the SQL query result set being stored on Cloud {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}}.

The default is `JOBPREFIX JOBID`, which means that `jobid=` is always appended to the target prefix.
You can optionally specify `JOBID NONE`, which skips the appending of `jobid=`. This means that the results are written
exactly to the requested path. However, if that path contains existing objects (for example, from a previous query execution with the same target path),
all existing objects get removed when the new result objects are written.

A query cannot run if `JOBPREFIX NONE` is specified and the target overlaps with at least one of the input URIs.
The reason is that data cannot be overwritten by a query that is reading that same data.
For example, `SELECT * FROM cos://us-geo/mybucket/myprefix/mysubprefix INTO cos://us-geo/mybucket/myprefix JOBPREFIX NONE`
will return an error when trying to submit it.

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/cosResultClause.svg" target="./diagrams/cosResultClause.svg" alt="syntax diagram for a COS result clause" layout="@break@" -->

<h3 id="partitionedClause">partitionedClause</h3>

You can use the result partitioned clause to control the layout of the SQL query result set being stored. The default behavior is to store the result into one single partition, that is a single object in Cloud {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}}.

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/partitionedClause.svg" target="./diagrams/partitionedClause.svg" alt="syntax diagram for a result partitioned clause" layout="@break@" -->

<h3 id="sortClause">sortClause</h3>

This clause can be used to sort in many ways. When specified in combination with PARTITIONED BY, it sorts the rows within each partition
by the sort order specified in the SORT BY clause. When specified in combination with PARTITIONED INTO, the same is done,
which is often referred to as clustering the rows by the specified columns into the fixed number of partitions specified by PARTITIONED INTO.
When specified without the PARTITIONED clause, it is equivalent to an ORDER BY clause specified at the top level of the SQL SELECT statement.

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/sortClause.svg" target="./diagrams/sortClause.svg" alt="syntax diagram for a result partitioned column clause" layout="@break@" -->

The *COS result clause* lets you explicitly specify the storage location and type of a query result on Cloud {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}}.
The storage location is specified by means of a `COSURI`.

Valid query result object types are: `AVRO`, `CSV`, `JSON`, `ORC`, or `PARQUET`. Note that object type names are not case sensitive.

Being able to explicitly specify the location and the type of the result object enables a user to take the following actions:
* Read *raw* data stored in one format, for example, CSV
* Cleanse the data using SQL constructs
* Store the cleansed data using an object type that offers benefits with respect to query performance and storage consumption on Cloud {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}}, for example, a column based object format like Parquet

Moreover, a user can explicitly define the way a query result is stored physically on Cloud {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} by using the *result partitioned clause*.

As shown in the syntax diagrams, there are three main use cases to define the physical layout of a query's result on Cloud {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}}:

1. Partition by columns, that is so-called Hive-style partitioning.
2. Partition into buckets/objects (both terms can be used synonymously), that is, generate the query result into objects, with or without specifying columns.
3. Partition by number of rows.

A partition is an object on Cloud {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} that is potentially a part of an aggregated object.
The presence of multiple partitions allows for parallel input/output (I/O) during query execution. Note that if no *result partitioned clause* is specified,
the query result is stored in a single partition on Cloud {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}}.

<h4>Partition by columns</h4>

Using the `PARTITIONED BY (column-list)` clause without specifying `INTO x BUCKETS/OBJECTS` lets you store the query result
using Hive-style partitioning, that is, to create partitions that contain only rows having certain values for one or more columns.
This physical layout should be chosen in case the stored object is further analyzed using SQL queries that specify predicates on the partition columns.

For example, a result object containing world-wide order data has a column `country` representing the country the order has been initiated from.
Partitioning the result object by the column `PARTITIONED BY (country)`, would create a result object with a partition for each country present in the query result.

Once the result object is stored this way on Cloud {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}}, each SQL query containing a predicate,
such as `country = 'USA'` or `country in ('MALTA', 'ITALY', 'VATICAN CITY')`, benefits from this physical layout. The reason is that during
SQL query execution only partitions containing data for the countries of interest have to be read. This tremendously cuts down the I/O traffic of the SQL query.

Some additional remarks on Hive-style partitioning:

1. Hive-style partitions have an eye-catching naming scheme, because the column names used for partitioning are part of the partition object prefix, for example, `/order/COUNTRY=USA/part-m-00000.snappy.parquet`.
2. Hive-style partitions do not contain any values for partition columns since their values are *stored* in the object prefix of the partition.
Thus, note that if you copy a HIVE-style partition and rename the object prefix by removing the partition column values, you are loosing data.
3. Hive-style partitions can have a tendency for data skewing, for example, the partition representing order data from Malta is very likely much smaller
than the partition representing order data from the USA. You can partition the query result into separate objects if you want to have *equally-sized* partitions.


<h4>Partition by columns into objects</h4>

Partitioning a query result into objects lets you specify the exact number of *equally-sized* result partitions. This lets you experimentally fine tune the number of objects to meet certain criteria for partition size. To specify the number of partitions, use the `PARTITIONED INTO x BUCKETS/OBJECTS` clause.

For example, knowing the size of the query result, it is possible to calculate the number of objects to end up with partitions having a certain size, for example, 128 MB, that is the HADOOP default file size, or any other size that meets application requirements.

The `INTO x BUCKETS/OBJECTS` clause can be combined with the `BY (column-list)` clause to create a certain number of partitions that support data affinity with respect to specified partition columns.

Continue with the example above specifying `PARTITION BY (customerid) INTO 10 OBJECTS` stores the query result into 10 objects ensuring that all data for a customer
is stored in the same partition. Note that although it is ensured that all data for a certain customer is stored in the same partition,
it is not ensured that the data is sorted physically according to the specified column.

<h4>Partition by number of rows</h4>

Partitioning by number of rows lets you specify the number of rows that go into a single partition. To specify the number of rows stored in each partition,
use the `EVERY x ROWS` clause. In case the row length of the result object is not varying heavily, the *partition every rows* clause also lets you create *almost equally-sized* result partitions.

Using the `PARTITIONED EVERY x ROWS` clause on a sorted query result ensures that partitions are created having a certain number of rows that are sorted according to the query's `SORT BY` clause. This physical layout can be useful to create partitions that are processed by an application in a pagination manner, for example, browsing order data sorted by *order date* and *customer id*.

Note that using `PARTITIONED EVERY x ROWS` clause causes data to be written single-threaded to Cloud {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}}, that is no parallel I/O is performed to write query results to Cloud {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}}.

<h3 id="dbResultClause">dbResultClause</h3>

You can use the Db result clause to specify that query results should be stored as a relational database table in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.
Currently, {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_long}} is the only supported target database.

Storing query results in a database will create a new table with the columns determined by the query result. When writing to Db2,
the following type mapping rules apply:
 * String types are mapped to CLOB columns.
 * Struct types are not mapped and have to be flattened first. See the `FLATTEN` [table transformation function](#tableTransformer).
 * Arrays, timeseries, and spatial data types are not mapped and have to be converted with appropriate SQL functions.

The table name and optional schema are specified as part of the target URI.
**Important**: If a table with the given name already exists in the target database, that table is dropped before the query executes
and all existing data is deleted.

You can use the `PARALLELISM x` clause to specify that multiple parallel database connections should be opened to write out
the result. Depending on the size of your result and the network connectivity of your target database service,
this can reduce the query processing time significantly.

## Fullselect Clause
{: #chapterFullSelectClause}

<h3 id="fullselect">fullselect</h3>

A *fullselect* is the core component of a *query*. It is the only mandatory general component for a valid query statement. The other components outside of *fullselect* are optional. Its syntax is defined by the syntax diagram below.

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/fullselect.svg" target="./diagrams/fullselect.svg" alt="syntax diagram for a fullselect" layout="@break@" -->

The result set defined by a single fullselect can be combined with the result set of one or more other fullselects using set operators.

The following set operators are supported and each set operator derives a result set from two other result sets R1 and R2:
* `INTERSECT`:  The result consists of all rows in R1 **and** R2.
* `UNION`: The result consists of all rows in R1 and R2.
* `EXCEPT`: The result consists of all rows that do not have a corresponding row in R2.
* `MINUS`: The minus operator is a synonym for the except operator and is supported for compatibility with other SQL implementations.

These set operators can be further refined by using the following modifiers:
* `DISTINCT`: This modifier ensures that the overall result set does not contain any duplicates. This is the default modifier that applies if no modifier is present.
* `ALL`: All rows of a fullselect's result set are combined using a set operator. Thus, the overall result set can contain duplicates.

Note that the following combination of set operators and set modifiers are not supported:
* `INTERSECT ALL`
* `EXCEPT ALL`
* `MINUS ALL`

The characteristics of a result set defined by a fullselect can be further defined using the following clauses:
* `ORDER BY`: Define an overall ordering of the result set based on the criteria defined by the list of `sortItem` clauses.
The default order direction is ascending if not explicitly specified by a `sortItem` clause. Note that the *order by* clause
cannot be used in conjunction with *cluster by*, *distribute by* or *sort by* clause.
* `DISTRIBUTE BY`: Distribute result set rows into new partitions based on the criteria defined by the list of `expression` clauses.
Result set rows having the same expression values will be moved to the same partition. Note that the *distribute by* clause cannot be
used in conjunction with *order by* or *cluster by* clause.
* `SORT BY`: The *sort by* clause lets you define an overall ordering on a partition base as defined by the list of `expression` clauses.
The default order direction is ascending if not explicitly specified by an `expression` clause.  The *sort by* clause is used in conjunction
with the *distribute by* clause.
* `CLUSTER BY`: Distribute result set rows into new partitions based on the criteria defined by the list of `expression` clauses. Moreover, each
partition is sorted in ascending order based on the criteria defined by the set of `expression` clauses. Thus, this clause represents a shortcut
for *distribute by* clause combined with *sort by* in ascending order. The *cluster by* attribute cannot be used in conjunction with the *order by*,
*distribute by*, *sort by* clause.
* `LIMIT`: Restrict the number of rows returned from the result set of the fullselect. The number of rows can be defined by an `expression` or using
the keyword `ALL` that causes all rows to be returned.

Note that `DISTRIBUTE BY`, `SORT BY` and `CLUSTER BY` only have an effect during your SQL query execution and do not influence the query result
written back to Cloud {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}}. Use these clauses only in execution of subqueries in order to optimize the outer
query execution that works on the intermediate result sets produced by the sub queries. In order to define the persistent target of the overall query
that is written back to Cloud {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}}, you need to use the dedicated [resultClause](#resultClause) instead.

<h3>Examples</h3>

The set operator examples use values clauses to define result sets for the set operations. For more details about the values clause refer to [valuesClause](#valuesClause).

```sql
-- set union eliminating duplicate rows
SELECT * FROM VALUES 1, 2 ,3 UNION VALUES 1, 2, 3
```
{: codeblock}

```sql
-- set union eliminating duplicate rows
SELECT * FROM VALUES 1, 2 ,3 UNION DISTINCT VALUES 1, 2, 3
```
{: codeblock}

## Simpleselect Clause
{: #chapterSimpleSelectClause}

A *simpleselect* is a component of a *fullselect*. Its syntax is defined by the syntax diagram below.

<h3 id="simpleselect">simpleselect</h3>

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/simpleselect.svg" target="./diagrams/simpleselect.svg" alt="syntax diagram for a simpleselect" layout="@break@"-->

The simpleselect lets you specify the following characteristics of a result set:
* The list of *result columns* from *relations* or *lateral views* that are part of the final result set. The result column list can be further redefined using the following modifier keywords:
    * `DISTINCT`: Eliminates all but one of each set of duplicate rows of the final result set.
    * `ALL`: Retains all rows of the final result set, and does not eliminate redundant duplicates. This is the default.
* The `FROM` clause defines the list of *relations* or *lateral views* that are combined to derive a result set.
* The `WHERE` clause defines the way how *relations* and *lateral views* are filtered and **joined** to derive a result set.
* In its simplest form the `GROUP BY` clause defines how rows qualifying for the final result set are grouped based on *grouping expressions*. Each group is represented by a single row in the final result set.
* The `HAVING` clause is used in conjunction with the *group by clause* to filter out groups from the final result set.

<h3 id="resultColumn">resultColumn</h3>

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/resultColumn.svg" target="./diagrams/resultColumn.svg" alt="syntax diagram for a result column" layout="" -->

A *result column* can be any expression that can optionally be associated with an identifier, that is, a *new name*. By providing custom identifiers you can control the column names used in the result data set written to Cloud {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}}.
Examples for such expressions are the following:
* A column name from one of the relations.
* An expression using column names from one or multiple relations.
* Arithmetic expressions performing calculations.

<h3>Group By Clause</h3>

<h4 id="groupByClause">groupByClause</h4>

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/groupByClause.svg" target="./diagrams/groupByClause.svg" alt="syntax diagram for a group by clause" layout="@break@" -->

<h4 id="groupingSet">groupingSet</h4>

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/groupingSet.svg" target="./diagrams/groupingSet.svg" alt="syntax diagram for a grouping set" layout="" -->

More complex *group by* clauses use so called *grouping sets* to provide more insights into the set of rows grouped by a grouping expression.

Grouping sets are best explained using examples. The set examples below use *values clauses* to define result sets for group by operations. For more details about the values clause, refer to [valuesClause](#valuesClause).

In the following example SQL query sales data is grouped per year and quarter.

```sql
-- grouping sales data per year and quarter
SELECT
    sales.col1 AS year,
    sales.col2 AS quarter,
    SUM(sales.col3) AS amount
FROM VALUES
    (2017, 1 ,100),
    (2017, 1 ,50),
    (2017, 2 ,200),
    (2017, 2 ,300),
    (2018, 1 ,300),
    (2018, 1 ,100),
    (2018, 2 ,400) AS sales
GROUP BY col1, col2
ORDER BY year, quarter
```
{: codeblock}


The result of the example query is shown in the table below.

|YEAR|QUARTER|AMOUNT|
|----|-------|------|
|2017|1      |150   |
|2017|2      |500   |
|2018|1      |400   |
|2018|2      |400   |
<!--table-caption title="Query result for example 'grouping sales data per year and quarter'"-->

A ROLLUP grouping is an extension to the *group by clause* that produces a result set containing subtotal rows in addition to the *regular* grouped rows.
A `GROUP BY COL1, COL2 WITH ROLLUP` generates the following grouping sets: **(COL1, COL2)**, **(COL1)**, **()**. Note that the **N** grouping expressions of the ROLLUP translate to **N+1** grouping sets.

Referring to the above example, adding a `WITH ROLLUP` modifier to the *group by* clause computes *rollup* sales data on quarter by year basis,
a yearly basis and a grand total as shown by the following example.

```sql
-- rollup sales data on quarter by year basis, a yearly basis and a grand total
SELECT
    sales.col1 AS year,
    sales.col2 AS quarter,
    SUM(sales.col3) AS amount
FROM VALUES
    (2017, 1 ,100),
    (2017, 1 ,50),
    (2017, 2 ,200),
    (2017, 2 ,300),
    (2018, 1 ,300),
    (2018, 1 ,100),
    (2018, 2 ,400) AS sales
GROUP BY col1, col2
WITH ROLLUP
ORDER BY year, quarter
```
{: codeblock}


The result of the example query is shown in the following table.

|YEAR|QUARTER|AMOUNT|
|----|-------|------|
|null|null   |1450  |
|2017|null   |650   |
|2017|1      |150   |
|2017|2      |500   |
|2018|null   |800   |
|2018|1      |400   |
|2018|2      |400   |
<!--table-caption title="Query result for example 'rollup sales data on quarter by year basis, a yearly basis and a grand total'"-->

A CUBE grouping is an extension to the *group by* clause that produces a result set that contains all the rows of a ROLLUP aggregation and,
in addition, grouping sets that do not represent a subtotal or grand total. A `GROUPY BY COL1, COL2 WITH CUBE` generates the following grouping sets:
**(COL1, COL2)**, **(COL1)**, **(COL2)**, **()**. The **N** elements of a CUBE translate to **2\*\*N** (2 to the power N) grouping sets.

Referring to the above example, adding a `WITH CUBE` modifier to the *group by* clause computes *rollup* sales data on a quarter by year basis, a yearly basis,
a quarterly year independent basis and a grand total as shown by the following example.

```sql
-- rollup sales data on a quarter by year basis, a yearly basis,
-- a quarterly year independent basis and a grand total
SELECT
    sales.col1 AS year,
    sales.col2 AS quarter,
    SUM(sales.col3) AS amount
FROM VALUES
    (2017, 1 ,100),
    (2017, 1 ,50),
    (2017, 2 ,200),
    (2017, 2 ,300),
    (2018, 1 ,300),
    (2018, 1 ,100),
    (2018, 2 ,400) AS sales
GROUP BY col1, col2
WITH CUBE
ORDER BY year, quarter
```

A GROUPING SETS grouping is an extension to the *group by clause* that lets you explicitly specify the grouping sets of interest. In other words, the ROLLUP and CUBE groupings are shortcuts for common grouping set use cases.

Referring to the above example, adding a `GROUPING SETS` modifier to the *group by* clause lets you compute *rollup* sales data on a quarter-by-year basis and a yearly basis only as shown below.

```sql
-- rollup sales data on a quarter by year basis and a yearly basis only
SELECT
    sales.col1 AS year,
    sales.col2 AS quarter,
    SUM(sales.col3) AS amount
FROM VALUES
    (2017, 1 ,100),
    (2017, 1 ,50),
    (2017, 2 ,200),
    (2017, 2 ,300),
    (2018, 1 ,300),
    (2018, 1 ,100),
    (2018, 2 ,400) AS sales
GROUP BY col1, col2
GROUPING SETS ( (COL1), (COL1, COL2) )
ORDER BY year, quarter
```

The result of the example query is shown in the table below.

|YEAR|QUARTER|AMOUNT|

## Relations
{: #chapterRelations}

A *relation* is a component of a *simpleselect* or a *relation primary* (which itself is a component of a *relation*). It is usually referred to as a *table*.

A relation is an entity that represents input data either stored physically on Cloud {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} or virtual intermediate results, for example, the virtual result table of a *subselect*, a *values clause*, a *common table expression*, or a *table valued function*. Relations can be queried or joined with other relations.

Specifying the physical data stored on Cloud {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} as a relation is done using the [externalTableSpec](#externalTableSpec) syntax. An example of a valid table URI is `cos://us-geo/sql/orders.parquet`, which references one of the sample tables provided by {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_short}} out of the box.

Multiple relations can be composed using join operators. The syntax for joining relations is defined by the syntax diagrams below.

<h3 id="relation">relation</h3>

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/relation.svg" target="./diagrams/relation.svg" alt="syntax diagram for a relation" layout="" -->

<h3 id="joinClause">joinClause</h3>

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/joinClause.svg" target="./diagrams/joinClause.svg" alt="syntax diagram for a join clause" layout="@break@" -->

<h3 id="naturalJoinClause">naturalJoinClause</h3>

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/naturalJoinClause.svg" target="./diagrams/naturalJoinClause.svg" alt="syntax diagram for a natural join clause" layout="@break@" -->

Relations can be joined using several types of joins that are described in detail in section [joinType](#joinType).

Apart from the join type, the following two different flavors of joins exist:
* Joins that specify a *join condition* by means of a `booleanExpression` or a `USING clause`.
* `NATURAL` joins that make an implicit guess which columns should be used for joining relations. Natural joins should be used carefully.

<h3 id="relationPrimary">relationPrimary</h3>

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/relationPrimary.svg" target="./diagrams/relationPrimary.svg" alt="syntax diagram for a relation primary" layout="" -->

<h3 id="externalTableSpec">externalTableSpec</h3>

An external table specification represents an URI for an object stored on Cloud {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} combined with a specification of the object type.
Valid values for object type identifier are `AVRO`, `CSV`, `JSON`, `ORC`, or `PARQUET`.
If the file format is CVS, the optional `FIELDS TERMINATED BY` <character> clause
allows you to specify a field delimiter/separator other than the default `,` (comma).

For example, the query for parsing a CSV with '|' as delimiter looks like the following:

`SELECT * FROM cos://us-geo/sql/BlackFriday.csv STORED AS CSV FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|' limit 3`

All one-character Unicode characters are allowed as delimiters.
If the format of the input files is CSV and the files don't have a header line (by default a header line is assumed), the optional `NOHEADER` keyword
allows you to specify that the files don't have a header line.
Refer to section [COS URI](#COSURI) for more details.

If the file format is PARQUET, the optional MERGE SCHEMA clause allows you to handle Parquet schema evolution by specifying that all qualifying Parquet objects
should be scanned for their schema and final schema should be merged across all objects. Note that by default, for Parquet input only the first Parquet object
found is used to infer the schema, which guarantees minimal overhead for compiling the SQL. Thus, use this option if your Parquet input data does not
have homogeneous schema.

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/externalTableSpec.svg" target="./diagrams/externalTableSpec.svg" alt="syntax diagram for an external table specification" layout="" -->

<h3 id="tableTransformer">tableTransformer</h3>

A table transformer is a function that is applied to the input data set before it is sent to the actual SQL query compilation and execution.

You can wrap your external table definition optionally with the `FLATTEN` table transformation function.
It will preprocess your input table before query compilation to a fully flat column schema.
This can be useful when you have hierarchical input data as it is often found in JSON documents.
By using `FLATTEN`, you don't have to dereference all nested columns explicitly in your SQL statement.

For example, you can run a simple `SELECT * FLATTEN(cos://us-geo/sql/iotmessages STORED AS JSON)` on a flattened JSON input and use CSV output to easily browse a sample of your JSON input data.

The `FLATTEN` table transformation function creates a flat list of columns by concatenating all nested column names with _.
You can optionally also combine `FLATTEN` with `CLEANCOLS`.

You can wrap your external table definition optionally with the `CLEANCOLS` table transformation function.
It will preprocess your input table before query compilation by renaming all columns that have characters that are NOT supported by certain target formats, such as Parquet.
These characters are `, ; ,,, =, (, ), { and }`. They are replaced by the corresponding URL-encoded representation, for example, %20 for space (` `). This allows you to write results, for example, into Parquet without having to provide column by column alias names in your SQL
when your input data has columns with these characters. A typical situation is the existence of space (` `) in input columns.

For example, you can use `SELECT * CLEANCOLS(cos://us-geo/sql/iotmessages STORED AS JSON)` to produce a result set that can be stored as is into Parquet target format.

You can optionally also combine `CLEANCOLS` with `FLATTEN`.

If you wrap your external table definition with the `DESCRIBE` table transformer,
the table does not show its actual content but the schema that is inferred from the objects in {{site.data.keyword.cos_full}} instead.
This allows you to explore the schema before authoring your actual SQL statements against it.

When you use the `DESCRIBE` table transformer in your SQL statement, the default output format is JSON instead of CSV.

You can also wrap `DESCRIBE` around the other table transformers in order to explore the transformed table schema.
However, you cannot wrap other table transformers around the `DESCRIBE` transformer.

<h3 id="tableValuedFunction">tableValuedFunction</h3>

A table-valued function returns a relation, that is, a set of rows. An example of a table-valued function is `range()`. Refer to the section about [SQL functions](/docs/services/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sqlfunctions#sqlfunctions) for more details.

## Values Clause
{: #chapterValuesClause}

A *values clause* is a component of a *fullselect* or represents a *primary relation*. Its syntax is defined by the syntax diagram below.

<h3 id="valuesClause">valuesClause</h3>

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/valuesClause.svg" target="./diagrams/valuesClause.svg" alt="syntax diagram for a values clause" layout="" -->

A values clause lets you define a result set by specifying actual values for each column of a row by means of expressions.

Each `expression` in the list of expressions represents a row of the result set that is defined.

In case of a single-column result set, each expression represents the value of this column in a row.

In case of a multi-column result set, each expression represents a list of *n* expressions enclosed by parantheses, where *n* is the number of columns in the result set.

To join a *values clause* with other types of result sets, specify an `identifier` that acts as an **alias** for the values clause.

<h3>Examples</h3>

```sql
-- single column result set with 3 rows
SELECT * FROM VALUES 1, 2 , 3
```
{: codeblock}


The result of the example query is shown in the table below.

|COL1|
|----|
|1   |
|2   |
|3   |
<!--table-caption title="Query result for example 'single column result set with 3 rows'"-->

```sql
-- single column result set with 3 rows specifying parantheses for row expressions
SELECT * FROM VALUES (1), (2) , (3)
```

The result of the example query is shown in the table below.

|COL1|
|----|
|1   |
|2   |
|3   |
<!--table-caption title="Query result for example 'single column result set with 3 rows specifying parantheses for row expressions'"-->

        (3, 'McCoy'),
        (4,'Scotty') AS emp,
    VALUES
        (1,3000),
        (2,2000),
        (3,3000),
        (4,4000) AS mission
WHERE emp.col1 = mission.col1
```
{: codeblock}


The result of the example query is shown in the table below.

|ID |NAME  |MISSIONS|
|---|------|--------|
|1  |Spock |3000    |

|3  |McCoy |3000    |
|4  |Scotty|4000    |
<!--table-caption title="Query result for example 'joining two multi column result sets using their identifier'"-->

## Values Statement
{: #chapterValuesStatement}

A *values statement* is a standalone statement on its own. It can be used instead of a *fullselect* if your statement only
references a single value and does not contain any join with other relations or values clauses.

<h3>Examples</h3>

```sql
-- values statement with single column result set with 3 rows
VALUES 1, 2 , 3
```
{: codeblock}


The result of the example query is shown in the table below.

|COL1|
|----|
|1   |
|2   |
|3   |
<!--table-caption title="Query result for example 'values statement with single column result set with 3 rows'"-->

```sql
--- values statement with multi column result set
VALUES
        (1, 'Spock'),
        (2,'Kirk') ,
        (3, 'McCoy'),
        (4,'Scotty')
```
{: codeblock}

The result of the example query is shown in the table below.

## Lateral Views
{: #chapterLateralViews}

A lateral view is a component of a *simpleselect*. Lateral views allow to build  *virtual tables* at query execution time
by means of *table-generating functions*. Examples of table-generating functions are `explode()`, `posexplode()`, and `posexplode_outer()`.
The explode()-style functions take an array or map as input and return a row for each element in the array. Refer to the section about [SQL functions](/docs/services/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sqlfunctions#sqlfunctions) for more details.

<h3 id="lateralView">lateralView</h3>

The syntax of a lateral view clause is described by the syntax diagram below.

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/lateralView.svg" target="./diagrams/lateralView.svg" alt="syntax diagram for a lateral view" layout="@break@" -->

The semantics of the entities in order of appearance in the syntax diagrams is as follows:
* `OUTER`: Specifying this keyword ensures that the lateral view contains at least one row with *null* values in case the table-generating function does not return any rows.
* `qualifiedName`: Name of a table-generating function.
* `expression`: An expression resolving to an array.
* `identifier`: Lateral view name, that is, the name of the new virtual table.
* `identifier`: Lateral view column names.

<h3>Examples</h3>

Lateral views are useful when dealing with repeating groups within a table, that is, not normalized tables. The examples show how to deal with tables that represent a 1-n relation and a n-m relation.

```sql
-- deal with a 1-n relation

SELECT
    master_child.col1 AS master_id,
    child_table.child_id
FROM VALUES
    ( 1 , ARRAY(1,2,3)),
    (2, ARRAY(4,5,6)) AS master_child
LATERAL VIEW EXPLODE(master_child.col2) child_table AS child_id
```
{: codeblock}


The result of the example query is shown in the table below.

|MASTER_ID|CHILD_ID|
|---------|--------|
|1        |1       |
|1        |2       |
|1        |3       |
|2        |4       |
|2        |5       |
|2        |6       |
<!--table-caption title="Query result for example 'deal with a 1-n relation'"-->

    master_table.master_id,
    child_table.child_id

    ( ARRAY(10,20) , ARRAY(1,2,3)),
    ( ARRAY(30,40), ARRAY(4,5,6)) AS master_child
LATERAL VIEW EXPLODE(master_child.col1) master_table AS master_id
LATERAL VIEW EXPLODE(master_child.col2) child_table AS child_id
```
{: codeblock}

## Join Types
{: #chapterJoinTypes}

SELECT statements can retrieve and join column values from two or more tables into a single row. The retrieval is based on a specified condition, typically of matching column values.

The main characteristic of a join is, typically, matching column values in rows of each table that participates in the join. The result of a join associates rows from one table with rows from another table. Depending on the type of join operation, some rows might be formed that contain column values in one table that do not match column values in another table.

A joined table specifies an intermediate result table that is the result of either an `INNER` join, an `OUTER` join, a `CROSS` join, or an `ANTI` join.
The table is derived by applying one of the join operators to its operands.

<h3 id="joinType">joinType</h3>

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/joinType.svg" target="./diagrams/joinType.svg" alt="syntax diagram for join types"  layout="" -->

<h4>Inner Join</h4>

An `INNER` join combines each row of the left table with each row of the right table, keeping only the rows in which the join condition is true.

```sql
-- inner join query
SELECT
    left_table.col1 AS l_col1,
    left_table.col2 AS l_col2,
    right_table.col1 AS r_col1,
    right_table.col2 AS r_col2
FROM
    VALUES (0, 10), (1, 11), (2, 12), (3,13), (4, 14), (5, 14) AS left_table
    INNER JOIN
    VALUES (0, 10), (2, 12), (4, 14), (6, 16) AS right_table
    ON left_table.col1 = right_table.col1
```
{: codeblock}


The result of the example query is shown in the table below.

|L_COL1|L_COL2|R_COL1|R_COL2|
|------|------|------|------|
|0     |10    |0     |10    |
|2     |12    |2     |12    |
|4     |14    |4     |14    |
<!--table-caption title="Query result for example 'inner join query'"-->

<h4>Outer Join</h4>

An `OUTER` join includes the rows that are produced by the inner join, plus the missing rows, depending on the type of outer join.

A `LEFT OUTER` or `LEFT` join includes the rows from the left table that were missing from the inner join.

```sql
-- left outer join query
SELECT
    left_table.col1 AS l_col1,
    left_table.col2 AS l_col2,
    right_table.col1 AS r_col1,
    right_table.col2 AS r_col2
FROM VALUES (0, 10), (1, 11), (2, 12), (3,13), (4, 14), (5, 14) AS left_table
LEFT OUTER JOIN
VALUES (0, 10), (2, 12), (4, 14), (6, 16) AS right_table
ON left_table.col1 = right_table.col1
```
{: codeblock}


The result of the example query is shown in the table below.

|L_COL1|L_COL2|R_COL1|R_COL2|

|4     |14    |4     |14    |
|5     |14    |null  |null  |
<!--table-caption title="Query result for example 'left outer join query'"-->

A `RIGHT OUTER` or `RIGHT` join includes the rows from the right table that were missing from the inner join.

```sql
-- right outer join query
SELECT
    left_table.col1 AS l_col1,
    left_table.col2 AS l_col2,
    right_table.col1 AS r_col1,
    right_table.col2 AS r_col2
FROM
    VALUES (0, 10), (1, 11), (2, 12), (3,13), (4, 14), (5, 14) AS left_table
    RIGHT OUTER JOIN
    VALUES (0, 10), (2, 12), (4, 14), (6, 16) AS right_table
    ON left_table.col1 = right_table.col1
```
{: codeblock}


The result of the example query is shown in the table below.

|L_COL1|L_COL2|R_COL1|R_COL2|

|null  |null  |6     |16    |
<!--table-caption title="Query result for example 'right outer join query'"-->

A `FULL OUTER` or `FULL` join includes the rows from both tables that were missing from the inner join.

```sql
-- full outer join query
SELECT
    left_table.col1 AS l_col1,
    left_table.col2 AS l_col2,
    right_table.col1 AS r_col1,
    right_table.col2 AS r_col2
FROM
    VALUES (0, 10), (1, 11), (2, 12), (3, 13), (4, 14), (5, 14) AS left_table
    FULL OUTER JOIN
    VALUES (0, 10), (2, 12), (4, 14), (6, 16) AS right_table
    ON left_table.col1 = right_table.col1
```

|0     |10    |0     |10    |
<!--table-caption title="Query result for example 'full outer join query'"-->

<h4>Cross Join</h4>

A `CROSS` join creates a Cartesian product of the tables involved in the join operation, if a CROSS join specifying a join condition behaves like an inner join.

```sql
-- cross join specifying a join condition

SELECT
    left_table.col1 AS l_col1,
    left_table.col2 AS l_col2,
    right_table.col1 AS r_col1,
    right_table.col2 AS r_col2
FROM
    VALUES (0, 10), (1, 11), (2, 12), (3,13), (4, 14), (5, 14) AS left_table
    CROSS JOIN VALUES (0, 10), (2, 12), (4, 14), (6, 16) AS right_table
    ON left_table.col1 = right_table.col1

<h4>Anti Join</h4>

A `LEFT ANTI` or `ANTI` join returns only rows from the left table that do not have a matching row in the right table.
Note that no columns from the right table can be included in the column list of the select statement.

```sql
-- left anti join query
SELECT
    left_table.col1 AS l_col1,
    left_table.col2 AS l_col2
FROM
    VALUES (0, 10), (1, 11), (2, 12), (3,13), (4, 14), (5, 14) AS left_table
    ANTI JOIN
    VALUES (0, 10), (2, 12), (4, 14), (6, 16) AS right_table
    ON left_table.col1 = right_table.col1
```
{: codeblock}


The result of the example query is shown in the table below.

|L_COL1|L_COL2|
|------|------|
|1     |11    |
|3     |13    |
|5     |14    |
<!--table-caption title="Query result for example 'left anti join query'"-->

<h4>Left Semi Join</h4>

A `LEFT SEMI` join acts like an inner join but does not include the columns of the right table.

```sql
-- left semi join query
SELECT
    left_table.col1 AS l_col1,
    left_table.col2 AS l_col2
FROM
    VALUES (0, 10), (1, 11), (2, 12), (3,13), (4, 14), (5, 14) AS left_table
    LEFT SEMI JOIN
    VALUES (0, 10), (2, 12), (4, 14), (6, 16) AS right_table
    ON left_table.col1 = right_table.col1
```
{: codeblock}

The result of the example query is shown in the table below.

|L_COL1|L_COL2|

## Sort Item Clause
{: #chapterSortItemClause}

*Sort items* are a component of a *fullselect* or a *window specification*.

<h3 id="sortItem">sortItem</h3>

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/sortItem.svg" target="./diagrams/sortItem.svg" alt="syntax diagram for a sort item"  layout="" -->

The semantics of the *sort item* components are as follows:
* `expression`: The expression represents a *sort key*. The value of the sort key is used to order the rows of the result.
* `ASC`: Uses the values of the sort key in ascending order. ASC is the default.
* `DESC`: Uses the values of the sort key in descending order.
* `NULLS`:
    * `FIRST`: Specifies that `NULL` values appear first in the order.
    * `LAST`: Specifies that `NULL` values appear last in the order.

<h3 id="functionOrAggregate">functionOrAggregate</h3>

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/functionOrAggregate.svg" target="./diagrams/functionOrAggregate.svg" alt="syntax diagram for a function or aggregate" layout="" -->

Most function invocations look like `function(argument1, ..., argumentN)` but functions like `TRIM()`, `POSITION()`, `FIRST()`, `LAST()`, and `STRUCT()` support a different invocation style.

Refer to section [SQL functions](/docs/services/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sqlfunctions#sqlfunctions) for details about supported functions.

## Window Functions
{: #chapterWindowFunctions}

Classic SQL **aggregation functions** like `SUM()`, `MAX()`, or `MIN()` process a group of rows to derive a single value. **Window functions** take this one step further by allowing to process a group of rows and derive a single value for each row in the group. Note that this is not the same as **scalar functions** that return a single value for each row. Scalar functions derive a single value from a single row and not a group of rows.

With window functions it is possible to calculate things like *moving averages* or *cumulative sums*.

Working with window functions involves two steps:
1. Choose a *window function* to answer the question of interest.
2. Define a *window* the chosen window function is applied to.

There are three types of window functions:

1. **Ranking functions**, for example, `rank()`, `ntile()`, or `rowNumber()`
2. **Analytic functions**, for example, `cume_dist()`, `first_value()`, or `last_value()`
3. **Aggregation functions**, for example, `sum()`, `max()`, or `min()`

Refer to the section about [SQL functions](/docs/services/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sqlfunctions#sqlfunctions) for more detailed information.

A window can be defined in two ways:
* The `WINDOW` keyword lets you define an identifier for a window specification in a *fullselect* or *simpleselect*. This named window specification can then be referenced by the `OVER` keyword.
* Unnamed window specifications can be defined inline following the keyword `OVER` in a *fullselect* or *simpleselect*.

The syntax of a window specification is defined by the syntax diagrams below.

<h3 id="windowOrderBy">windowOrderBy</h3>

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/windowOrderBy.svg" target="./diagrams/windowOrderBy.svg" alt="syntax diagram for a window order by clause" layout="" -->

The window specification consists of the following clauses:
* The `PARTITION BY` clause defines which rows belong to the same *window partition*. `DISTRIBUTE BY` can be used as a synonym for `PARTITION BY`.
* The `ORDER BY` clause defines the ordering of rows within a window partition. `SORT BY` can be used as a synonym for `ORDER BY`.
* There are two ways to define a *window size*:
    * `RANGE`: The window size is defined as a value range.
    * `ROW`: The window size is defined as the number of rows before and/or after the current row.
* The following keywords can be used to define range boundaries:
    * `CURRENT ROW`: Specifies to use the current row as a bound.
    * `UNBOUNDED`: Specifies to use negative or positive infinity as a lower or upper bound respectively.
    * Depending on the context `PRECEDING` specifies:
        * `RANGE`: The lower bound of the value range.
        * `ROWS`: The number of rows before the current row.
    * Depending on the context `FOLLOWING` specifies:
        * `RANGE`: The upper bound of the value range.
        * `ROWS`: The number of rows after the current row.

<h3>Examples</h3>

The window function examples below use *values clauses* to define result sets for group by operations. For more details about the values clause refer to [valuesClause](#valuesClause).

<h4>Ranking Function Example</h4>

This example uses a table containing information about employee social media activity (posts):
* Column 1: employee ID
* Column 2: department ID
* Column 3: number of social media posts

The example shows how to retrieve the ID of the two most active employees in each department.

```sql
-- derive posts ranking using a named window specification
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT
        posts.col1 AS emp_id,
        posts.col2 AS dept_id,
        posts.col3 AS posts,

<h4>Analytic Function Example</h4>

This example uses a table containing transaction information. The layout is as follows:
* Column 1: transaction ID
* Column 2: account number
* Column 3: transaction amount

The example shows how to create a cumulative distribution of transaction amounts using the analytic function `CUME_DIST()`.
The `CUME_DIST()` function returns the percentage of rows having a value less than or equal to the current rowâs value.

```sql
-- cumulative distribution of transaction amounts
SELECT
    txn_amount,
    MAX(balance_dist)
FROM (
        SELECT
            txn.col2 AS account,
            txn.col3 AS txn_amount,
            CUME_DIST() OVER current_balance AS balance_dist
        FROM VALUES
            (1, 42, 1000),
            (2, 4711, 2000),
            (3, 42, -200),
            (4, 42, -200),
            (5, 4711, 1000),
            (6, 4711, -300),
            (7, 4711, -300),
            (8, 42, 1000),
            (9, 4711, -400) AS txn
        WINDOW current_balance AS (ORDER BY txn.col3)
        ORDER BY txn.col3
)
GROUP BY txn_amount
```
{: codeblock}

The result of the example query is shown in the table below.

|2000      |1.0               |
<!--table-caption title="Query result for example 'cumulative distribution of transaction amounts'"-->

<h4>Aggregation Function Example</h4>

This example uses a table containing transaction information. The layout is as follows:
* Column 1: transaction ID
* Column 2: account number
* Column 3: transaction amount

The example shows how to retrieve the *total balanace* of each account at the time of each transaction.

```sql
--- total balance of each account at the time of each transaction
SELECT
    txn.col1 AS txn_id,
    txn.col2 AS account,
    txn.col3 AS txn_amount,
    SUM(txn.col3) OVER current_balance AS balance
FROM VALUES
    (1, 42, 100),
    (2, 4711, 300),
    (3, 42, 50),
    (4, 42, -250),
    (5, 4711, 1000),
    (6, 4711, -300),
    (7, 4711, 100),
    (8, 42, 200),
    (9, 4711, -400) AS txn
WINDOW current_balance AS (
        PARTITION BY txn.col2
        ORDER BY txn.col1
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
) ORDER BY account, txn_id
```

<h4 id="booleanExpression">booleanExpression</h4>

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/booleanExpression.svg" target="./diagrams/booleanExpression.svg" alt="syntax diagram for a Boolean expression" layout="" -->

A Boolean expression is one of the following:
* A negation of a boolean expression using Boolean operator `NOT`.
* A conjunction of boolean expressions using Boolean operator `AND`.
* A conjunction of boolean expressions using Boolean operator `OR`.
* An `EXIST` predicate.
* A *value expression* optionally followed by a *predicate*.

Refer to [booleanOperator](#booleanOperator) for details about Boolean operators `NOT`, `AND`, and `OR`.

The `EXISTS` predicate tests for the existence of certain rows. The `query` can specify any number of columns, and the following applies:
* The result is true only if the number of rows specified by the fullselect is not zero.
* The result is false only if the number of rows specified is zero.
* The result cannot be unknown.

<h4 id="interval">interval</h4>

An *interval clause* lets you define time duration constants that can be used in expressions to add or subtract time ranges from a timestamp value.

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/interval.svg" target="./diagrams/interval.svg" alt="syntax diagram for an interval"  layout="" -->

<h4 id="timeUnitSpec">timeUnitSpec</h4>

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/timeUnitSpec.svg" target="./diagrams/timeUnitSpec.svg" alt="syntax diagram for a time unit specification"  layout="" -->

The following time units are valid:
* Singular form: `SECOND`, `MINUTE`, `DAY`, `MONTH`, `YEAR`
* Plural form: `SECONDS`, `MINUTES`, `DAYS`, `MONTHS`, `YEARS`

Both singular and plural forms can be used interchangeably.

The following example demonstrates how to add and subtract several timeunits from the current timestamp.

```sql
-- add and subtract several timeunits from the current timestamp
SELECT
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    - INTERVAL 2 YEARS
    + INTERVAL 1 MONTH
    - INTERVAL 3 DAYS
    + INTERVAL 10 HOURS
    + interval 30 MINUTES
    - INTERVAL 20 SECOND AS past_timestamp
FROM VALUES ("dummy")
```
{: codeblock}


The result of the example query is shown in the table below.

|PAST_TIMESTAMP         |
|-----------------------|
|2016-11-13 20:23:43.621|
<!--table-caption title="Query result for example 'add and subtract several timeunits from the current timestamp'"-->

Since interval clauses can get quite long, especially if days, hours, minutes, and seconds are involved, it is possible to use an abbreviated syntax by specifying a format `STRING` and using the `TO` keyword.

The format `STRING` can be used to specify the following time intervals:
* `YEAR TO MONTH` interval using a format string complying to `signYEAR-MONTH` with the following:
    * `sign`: optional `+` or `-` sign
    * `YEAR`: number of years
    * `MONTH`: number of months
* `DAY TO SECOND` interval using a format string complying to `signDAY HOUR:MINUTE:SECOND` with the following:
    * `sign`: optional `+` or `-` sign
    * `DAY`: number of days
    * `HOUR`: number of hours
    * `MINUTE`: number of minutes
    * `SECOND`: number of seconds

Note that when specifying a time interval using keyword `TO`, only the singular form of a time unit `identifier` is supported.

The following table shows equivalent interval clauses:

| INTERVAL expression | INTERVAL TO expression |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| INTERVAL 1 DAY - INTERVAL 2 HOURS - INTERVAL 3 MINUTES - INTERVAL 4 SECONDS | INTERVAL '1 2:3:4.100' DAY TO SECOND |
| INTERVAL 1 YEAR - INTERVAL 2 MONTH | INTERVAL '1-2' YEAR TO MONTH |
<!--table-caption title="Equivalent INTERVAL Clauses"-->

The following example demonstrates equivalent interval expressions when dealing with `YEAR` and `MONTH` time units.

```sql
-- equivalent interval expressions with YEAR and MONTH time units
WITH ts AS (
    SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS now FROM VALUES ('dummy')
    )
SELECT
  now - INTERVAL 1 YEAR - INTERVAL 2 MONTH AS LONG_VERSION,
    now - INTERVAL '1-2' YEAR TO MONTH  AS SHORT_VERSION
FROM ts
```

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/predicate.svg" target="./diagrams/predicate.svg" alt="syntax diagram for a predicate" layout="" -->

The `BETWEEN ... AND` predicate compares a value with a range of values. If `NOT` is specified, the result is reversed.

The `IN` predicate compares a value or values with a collection of values. The range of values is either defined by a query or a list of expressions enclosed in parentheses.
The query must identify a number of columns that is the same as the number of expressions specified to the left of the IN keyword.
In addition, the number of elements in the list of expressions must be the same as the number of expressions specified to the left of the IN keyword.
If `NOT` is specified, the result is reversed.

The `LIKE` predicate searches for strings that have a certain pattern. The pattern is specified by a string in which certain characters have a special meaning.
* The underscore character `_` represents any single character.
* The percent sign `%` represents a string of zero or more characters.
* Any other character represents itself. Thus trailing blanks in a pattern are part of the pattern.
If `NOT` is specified, the result is reversed.

The `RLIKE` predicate searches for a regular expression pattern in a string. If the pattern expression is found, the result is true.
If the pattern expression is not found, the result is false. If the value of any of the arguments is null, the result of the RLIKE predicate is unknown.
If `NOT` is specified, the result is reversed.

The regular expression pattern has to be a Java regular expression as defined by Java class `java.util.regex.Pattern`.
Meta characters starting with a `\` have to be escaped for the regular expression to work, for example, use `\\d` instead of `\d`
in a pattern string to represent a digit. Refer to latest Java documentation for more details like supported meta characters, predefined character classes, and so on.

The `IS NULL` predicate tests for null values. The result of a NULL predicate cannot be unknown. If the value of the expression is null, the result is true. If the value is not null, the result is false. If `NOT` is specified, the result is reversed.

The `IS DISTINCT FROM` predicate compares two expressions and evaluates to TRUE if their values are not identical. The result of a DISTINCT predicate cannot be null. If `NOT` is specified, the result is reversed. The result of a DISTINCT predicate depends on whether either or both of its input expressions are null:

| Input expressions | IS DISTINCT FROM | IS NOT DISTINCT FROM |
| :----| :---- | :---- |
| Both inputs are non-null. | Evaluates to TRUE if the inputs are not identical and FALSE if they are. Equivalent to the <> operator. | Evaluates to FALSE if the inputs are not identical and TRUE if they are. Equivalent to the = operator. |
| One input is null. | Evaluates to TRUE. | Evaluates to FALSE. |
| Both inputs are null. | Evaluates to FALSE. | Evaluates to TRUE. |
<!--table-caption title="NULL Values and DISTINCT Predicate Value"-->

The following DISTINCT predicates are logically equivalent to the corresponding search conditions:

| DISTINCT predicate | Search condition |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| value 1 IS NOT DISTINCT FROM value2 | (value1 IS NOT NULL AND value2 IS NOT NULL AND value1 = value 2) OR (value1 IS NULL AND value2 IS NULL) |
| value 1 IS DISTINCT FROM value2 | NOT (value1 IS NOT DISTINCT FROM value2)|
<!--table-caption title="DISTINCT Predicate and Search Condition"-->

<h3>Cast Expression</h3>

The syntax of a *cast expression* is described by the syntax diagrams below.

The cast specification returns the cast operand (the first operand) cast to the type specified by the data type.

If the specified data type is not supported, an error is returned.

<h4 id="castExpression">castExpression</h4>

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/castExpression.svg" target="./diagrams/castExpression.svg" alt="syntax diagram for a cast expression" layout="" -->

Note that in case an expression cannot be casted to the data type specified in the cast expression, the expression result is `null`.

<h4 id="dataType">dataType</h4>

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/dataType.svg" target="./diagrams/dataType.svg" alt="syntax diagram for a data type" layout="" -->

An `identifier` in a cast expression can have the values listed below.

<h5>Numeric Types</h5>

Numeric data types are summarized in the table below.

| Identifier | Type | Bytes | Minimum Value | Maximum Value |
| :---- | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| `TINYINT` | signed integer | 1 | -128 | 127 |
| `SMALLINT` | signed integer | 2 | -32768 | 32767 |
| `INT` | signed integer | 4 | -2147483648 | 2147483647 |
| `INTEGER` | signed integer | 4 | -2147483648 | 2147483647 |
| `BIGINT` | signed integer | 8 | -9223372036854775808 | 9223372036854775807 |
| `FLOAT` | single precision floating point number | 4 | n/a | n/a |
| `DOUBLE` | double precision floating point number | 8 | n/a | n/a |
| `DOUBLE PRECISION` | double precision floating point number | 8 | n/a | n/a |
| `DECIMAL` | precision of 38 digits | n/a | -10e37+1 | 10e37-1 |
<!--table-caption title="Numeric Data Types"-->

<h5>String Types</h5>

Supported string type identifiers are `VARCHAR` and `CHAR`.

<h5>Date and Time Types</h5>

String values with appropriate formats can be converted to a timestamp or date, using data type `TIMESTAMP` or `DATE`, respectively.

```sql
-- cast string values to timestamp and date types
SELECT
    CAST('2018-10-31 23:55:00' AS TIMESTAMP),
    CAST('2018-10-31 23:55:00' AS DATE),
    CAST('HELLO' AS TIMESTAMP)
FROM VALUES ('dummy')
```
{: codeblock}


The result of the example query is shown in the table below.

|CAST(2018-10-31 23:55:00 AS TIMESTAMP)|CAST(2018-2-28 23:55:00 AS DATE)|CAST(HELLO AS TIMESTAMP)|
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------|
|2018-10-31 23:55:00.0                 |2018-02-28                      |null                    |
<!--table-caption title="Query result for example 'cast string values to TIMESTAMP and DATE types'"-->

<h5>Misc Types</h5>

<h6>Boolean Type</h6>

The `BOOLEAN` type represents a domain with two values, `true` or `false`.

Any numeric value representing zero, for example, `0`, `0.0`, or `0.0E10`, can be casted to `false`.

Numeric values representing a nonzero value, for example, 1, 1.0, 1.0E10, or 21474.83648 can be casted to `true`.

The string value `'0'` can be casted to `false` and `'1'` can be casted to `true`, respectively. Any other string value is casted to `false`.

<h6>Binary Type</h6>

A `BINARY` type represents an array of byte values. Thus, string values can be casted to type `BINARY`.

<h3>Case Expressions</h3>

A case expression allows an expression to be selected based on the evaluation of one or more conditions.

The syntax of a case expression is described by the syntax diagrams below.

<h4 id="caseExpression">caseExpression</h4>

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/caseExpression.svg" target="./diagrams/caseExpression.svg" alt="syntax diagram for a case expression" layout="" -->

The upper path in the syntax diagram represents a *searched when clause*, that is, the `WHEN` keyword follows directly after the `CASE` keyword.
The lower path is a *simple when clause*, that is, an expression follows after the `CASE` keyword.

In general, the value of the case expression is the value of the *result expression*, following the first (leftmost) case that evaluates to true.
If no case evaluates to true and the ELSE keyword is present, the result is the value of the ELSE case result expression.
If no case evaluates to true and the ELSE keyword is not present, the result is NULL. Note that when a case evaluates to unknown (because of NULLs), the case is not true and hence is treated the same way as a case that evaluates to false.

When using the *simple when clause*, the value of the expression before the first WHEN keyword is tested for equality with the value of the expression following the WHEN keyword. The data type of the expression before the first WHEN keyword must therefore be comparable to the data types of each expression following the WHEN keyword(s).

A *result expression* is an expression following the `THEN` or `ELSE` keywords.

<h4 id="whenClause">whenClause</h4>

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/whenClause.svg" target="./diagrams/whenClause.svg" alt="syntax diagram for a when clause" layout="" -->

<!--table-caption title="Query result for example 'simple case expression with ELSE clause'"-->

There are two scalar functions, `NULLIF()` and `COALESCE()`, that are specialized to handle a subset of the functionality provided by `CASE`.

| Expression | Equivalent Expression |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| CASE WHEN e1=e2 THEN NULL ELSE e1 END | NULLIF(e1,e2) |
| CASE WHEN e1 IS NOT NULL THEN e1 ELSE e2 END| COALESCE(e1,e2) |
| CASE WHEN e1 IS NOT NULL THEN e1 ELSE COALESCE(e2,...,eN) END| COALESCE(e1,e2,...,eN)|

The following types of operators can be used:
* [Unary](#unaryOperator)
* [Aithmetic](#arithmeticOperator)
* [String](#stringOperator)
* [Comparison](#comparisonOperator)
* [Boolean](#booleanOperator)

<h3 id="unaryOperator">Unary operators</h3>

| Operator | Operand types | Description |
| :----: | ---- | ---- |
| `-A` | All number types | Unary negative operator. The type of the result is the same as the type of A. |
| `+A` | All number types | Unary positive operator. The type of the result is the same as the type of A. |
| `~A` | All number types | Bitwise NOT operator. The type of the result is the same as the type of A. |
<!--table-caption title="Unary operators"-->

<h3 id="arithmeticOperator">Arithmetic operators</h3>

| Operator | Operand types | Description |
| :----: | ---- | ---- |
| `A + B`   | All number types | Returns the result of adding A and B. The type of the result is the same as the type of the operand that is highest in the type hierarchy. For example, if A is of type FLOAT and B is of type INT, the result is of type FLOAT. |
| `A - B`   | All number types | Returns the result of subtracting B from A. The type of the result is the same as the type of the operand that is highest in the type hierarchy. For example, if A is of type FLOAT and B is of type INT, the result is of type FLOAT. |
| `A * B`   | All number types | Returns the result of multiplying A and B. The type of the result is the same as the type of the operand that is highest in the type hierarchy. For example, if A is of type FLOAT and B is of type INT, the result is of type FLOAT. If the operation causes an overflow, cast at least one of the operators to a type that is higher in the type hierarchy. |
| `A / B`   | All number types | Returns the result of dividing A by B. The type of the result is DOUBLE. |
| `A % B`   | All number types | Returns the reminder after dividing A by B.  For example, 13.7 % 3 returns 1.7. The type of the result is the same as the type of the operand that is highest in the type hierarchy. For example, if A is of type FLOAT and B is of type INT, the result is of type FLOAT. |
| `A DIV B` | Integer types    | Returns the integer part of the result of dividing A by B. For example, 13.7 DIV 3 returns the integer 4. |
| `A & B`   | All number types | Returns the result of bitwise AND of A and B. The type of the result is the same as the type of the operand that is highest in the type hierarchy. |
| <code>A &#124; B</code> | All number types | Returns the result of bitwise OR of A and B. The type of the result is the same as the type of the operand that is highest in the type hierarchy. |
| `A ^ B`  | All number types | Returns the result of bitwise XOR of A and B. The type of the result is the same as the type of the operand that is highest in the type hierarchy. |
<!--table-caption title="Arithmetic operators"-->

<h3 id="stringOperator">String operator</h3>

| Operator | Operand types | Description |
| :----: | ---- | ---- |
| <code>A &#124;&#124; B</code> |  All types | Returns the concatenation of A and B. If A or B is not a string, it is first converted into a string type. The result is a string. |
<!--table-caption title="String operator"-->

<h3 id="comparisonOperator">Comparison operators</h3>

| Operator | Operand types | Description |
| :----: | ---- | ---- |
| `A = B` | All primitive types | Returns TRUE if A is equal to B; FALSE otherwise. |
| `A == B`| All primitive types| Synonym for the equal (=) operator. |

## Sampling Table Data
{: #chapterSamplingTableData}

Any table, that is, object stored on Cloud {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}}, used in a *from clause*, can be associated with a *table sample clause*.
The table sample clause defines how to retrieve a subset of rows from the underlying table (object stored on Cloud {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}}). This lets you write queries for samples of the data, for example, for the purpose of interactive data exploration, data mining, and so on.

The general syntax of a table sample clause is described by the syntax diagram below.

<h3 id="sample">sample</h3>

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/sample.svg" target="./diagrams/sample.svg" alt="syntax diagram for a sample" layout="" -->

<h3 id="bucketSampleClause">bucketSampleClause</h3>

<!--include-svg src="./svgfiles/bucketSampleClause.svg" target="./diagrams/bucketSampleClause.svg" alt="syntax diagram for a bucket sample clause" layout="@break@" -->

Three sampling types are supported:

* `TABLESAMPLE <number> PERCENT` lets you sample a certain percentage of rows from the underlying table.
* `TABLESAMPLE <expression> ROWS` lets you sample a certain number of rows from the underlying table.
* `TABLESAMPLE BUCKET x OUT OF y` lets you bucketize the underlying data into `y` buckets and returns rows from bucket `x`. Buckets are numbered from `1`to `y`.

<h3>Examples</h3>

The following examples demonstrate how to sample a subset of data from a Parquet object on Cloud {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}}.
Note that the object referenced is accessible from the web UI as part of the provided sample queries.

```sql
-- retrieve 10 percent of employee data
SELECT * FROM cos://us-geo/sql/employees.parquet STORED AS PARQUET TABLESAMPLE (10 PERCENT)
```
{: codeblock}

```sql
-- retrieve 10 rows from the employee data object
SELECT * FROM cos://us-geo/sql/employees.parquet STORED AS PARQUET TABLESAMPLE (10 ROWS)
```
{: codeblock}

```sql
-- bucketize the employee data in 10 buckets and retrieve data from 2 buckets
SELECT * FROM cos://us-geo/sql/employees.parquet STORED AS PARQUET TABLESAMPLE (BUCKET 2 OUT OF 10)
```
{: codeblock}

## Miscellaneous Definitions
{: #chapterMiscDefinitions}

<h3 id ="COSURI">COSURI</h3>

A Cloud {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} Uniform Resource Identifier (COS URI) is a string of characters that uniquely identifies an object on Cloud {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}}. By definition URIs are case-insensitive.

The syntax of a COS URI is thoroughly described in section [Table unique resource identifier](/docs/services/sql-query?topic=sql-query-overview#table-unique-resource-identifier).

<h3 id ="CRN_TABLE">CRN_TABLE</h3>

A database table CRN is a unique identifier consisting of the CRN of a database service instance and a specific table name that instance.
The user must have access to this service instance and its credentials.

The syntax of a table CRN is thoroughly described in section [Table unique resource identifier](/docs/services/sql-query?topic=sql-query-overview#table-unique-resource-identifier).

<h3 id ="DB2_TABLE_URI">DB2_TABLE_URI</h3>

A Db2 table URI is a string of characters that uniquely identifies a table in a {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_long_notm}} instance. The instance must be enabled for IAM and the IBMid of the user must have been added as a database user.

The syntax of a Db2 Table URI is thoroughly described in section [Table unique resource identifier](/docs/services/sql-query?topic=sql-query-overview#table-unique-resource-identifier).

<h3 id="identifier">Identifier</h3>

An *identifier* is a name that uniquely identifies an entity. There are two types of identifiers, unquoted identifiers and backquoted identifiers.

<h4>Unquoted Identifier</h4>

An unquoted identifier is at least one character long. Valid characters that can be used are the following:
* Digits 0-9
* Letters a-z, A-Z
* Underscore `_`

<h4>Backquoted Identifier</h4>

This is an identifier that is embraced by grave accent <code>&#96;</code> characters. Backquoted identifier can
contain any character including the grave accent character that has to be escaped like this <code>&#96;&#96;</code>.

<h3 id="number">Number</h3>

A number is either a signed or unsigned *integer* or a *decimal* number.

<h3 id="unsignedNumber">Unsigned Number</h3>

An unsigned number is an *integer* or *decimal* number without sign or type suffix.

<h3 id="unsignedInteger">Unsigned Integer Number</h3>

An unsigned integer is an *integer* number without sign or type suffix.

<h4 id="INTEGER_VALUE">Integer Number</h4>

An integer number is represented by a sequence of at least one digit, that is, `0` to `9`.
The integer number can have a suffix denoting the type of integer number. There are three types of integer numbers:
* `Y`: tiny integer number
* `S`: small integer number
* `L`: big integer number

See section [dataType](#dataType) for more details about data types.

<h4 id="DECIMAL_VALUE">Decimal Number</h4>

A decimal number is the following:
* A sequence of at least one digit followed by a positive or negative exponent, for example, `10E2` represents integer `1000` and `1E-1` represents 0.1.
* A decimal number, for example, `3.14`.
* A decimal number followed by a positive or negative exponent , for example, `3.14E+3` represents `3140.00` or `3.14E-3` represents `0.00314`.

The decimal number can have a suffix denoting the type of decimal number. There are two types of decimal numbers:
* `D`: double decimal number
* `BD`: big decimal number

See section [dataType](#dataType) for more details about data types.

<h3 id="STRING">String</h3>

A *string* is a sequence of arbitrary characters including escaped characters, for example,
`\t`, either enclosed in single quotes `'`, or double quotes, `"`.
To include any quote characters in the string they have to be escaped as <code>\\\\&#96;</code> or `\\"`, respectively.
